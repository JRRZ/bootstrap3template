Use this project folder as a starting point for any bootstrap project.

Instructions for getting started:

SET UP CODE KIT PROCESS LESS FILES

1. Open CodeKit

2. Drag the project folder ‘bootstrap3template’ into the CodeKit Window

3. Under 'Styles' make sure boostrap.less outputs to /_/components/css/bootstrap.css, and that the Output Style dropdown is set to 'Compressed', no need to click 'Compile', as this was already done in the process of setting up this project

4. Select _mystyles.less and uncheck 'Do not compile directly'

5. Right click _mystyles.less and select 'Set Output Path'. Choose the folder '_/css', and change the Output file name to 'mystyles.css'. (this is where you'll add your own style code)

6. Still on _mystyles.less, set the 'Output Style' drowpdown to 'Compressed'.

7. Click 'Compile'.

SET UP CODE KIT TO MINIFY JAVASCRIPT FILES

1. Select '/_/components/js/_myscript.js'

2. Uncheck 'Do not compile directly'

3. Right click, select 'Set output path', set it to /_/js/myscript.js (Remove the underscore)

4. Set the 'Check Syntax With' dropdown to 'Nothing'

5. Click 'Process'

6. Repeat these steps for '_bootstrap.js'


SET UP A LOCAL SERVER USING MAMP PRO

1. Click the '+' in the bottom left
2. Under the 'General' tab, choose a server name such as 's.project.com'
3. Set the Port # to 80 (the second box in 'IP / Port')
4. Choose your project folder as the Disk location 
5. Click 'Apply'
6. Click 'Start' at the top of the window

OPEN YOUR BROWSER TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS

1. Go to the URL you created in Step #2 above (s.project.com)
2. You should see the starting template with Bootstrap styling

NOW YOU'RE READY TO BUILD AN AWESOME SITE!

Tips:

1. Make sure CodeKit is open while you work on your project.

2. To add your own custom LESS, add your code in _/components/less/_mystyles.less

3. Write your own JS in _myscript.js

(Basically as long as you have done the CodeKit steps above, any files with '_' are the ones you type into, and CodeKit compresses those and outputs to the 'non-underscore' version automatically).
